  <p>Participated in NYU's CS4CS - Computer Science for Cyber Security, a selective NYU program for aspiring tech students. During the program, I developed foundational skills in ethical hacking, data encryption, protocols, and key cybersecurity principles. I collaborated in tea,-based simulations and technical challenges to apply security knowledge in real-world scenarious. At the end of the program, I presented group research on vulnerabilities in public Wi-Fi networks, the growing risks associated with AI systems, and their potential implications for air traffic control.</p>
  <p>Participated in Stanford University's Neuroscience Journal Club, a program for high school students to explore neuroscience through weekly journal discussions and mentorship from Stanford researchers and faculty. I participated in peer-led discussions on research in cognitive sciences, presented insights on emergin topics such as brain-machine interfaces, and developed scientific literacy and interdisciplinary thinking through guided analysis of academic literature.</p>
  <p>Co-Founder/President of a HOSA (Future Health Proffesionals) chapter at my high school. It is a student-led organization that promotes career development in healthcare fields, through leadership, education, and competitive events. I led chapter meetings, coordinated event participation, and organized community service projects.
